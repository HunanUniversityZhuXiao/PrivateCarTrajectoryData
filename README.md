# PrivateCarTrajectoryData

We appreciate your interests in the private car trajectory dataset collected through our algorithms and devices. 

Remarks：The process of trajectory collection and data transmission is purely anonymous. Specifically, it is not to collect any personal information regarding the vehicles (the vehicle ID has been anonymized as a bit string) as well as the drivers. For the collection of the trajectory dataset, we ensure that the users have been well understood the process of the data collection. In other words, the usage of our data collection devices is entirely up to users. We have received the approval from the users before we install devices on their vehicles. In addition, they gave their consent to educational institutions to study and use their data for research purposes.

Now, we offer free and public access to our dataset, please feel free to use our data on nonprofit, scientific purposes. If you would like to access the data, please sign the agreement  and send a scanned copy to us via zhxiao@hnu.edu.cn. In 14 working days, we will send you our dataset as well as the Python code packet. The ‘ReadMe.doc’ in the packet gives a detailed instruction of the Python code to run the  algorithm based on our private car trajectory dataset.
