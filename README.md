# PrivateCarTrajectoryData

1） We appreciate your interests in the private car trajectory dataset collected through our algorithms and devices. 

Remarks：The process of trajectory collection and data transmission is purely anonymous. Specifically, it is not to collect any personal information regarding the vehicles (the vehicle ID has been anonymized as a bit string) as well as the drivers. For the collection of the trajectory dataset, we ensure that the users have well understood the process of the data collection. In other words, the usage of data collection devices is entirely up to the users and they are fully aware of the processing of trajectory collection. We have received the approval from the users before we install devices on their vehicles. In addition, they gave their consent to educational institutions to study and use their data for research purposes.

Now, we offer free and public access to our dataset, please feel free to use our data on nonprofit, scientific purposes. If you would like to access the data, please sign the agreement  and send a scanned copy to us via zhxiao@hnu.edu.cn. In 14 working days, we will send you our dataset as well as the Python code packet. The ‘ReadMe.doc’ in the packet gives a detailed instruction of the Python code to run the  algorithm based on our private car trajectory dataset.

Indeed, our trajecotory dataset has received wide interests both from the industry and academic. At present, in response to the requests on the data, we have shared the vehicle trajectory dataset to more than 20 institutes around the world. We are happy to see that our vehicle trajectory data can promote the researches and applications in driving behavior analysis, collision avoidance systems, intelligent transportation systems, usage based insurance (UBI), urban planning etc.

2） At present, Zhejiang Lab has established a cooperative relationship with Hunan University, shared and uploading various datasets, including the private car trajectory data, bicycle trajectory data and data on disease transmission. We welcome to apply, together engaged in data mining and data analysis related academic research.

Instruction:
There are three python pkl files (post/comment/like) and a Jupyter Notebook Document to read the dataset as Pandas Dataframe. Images are stored in binary format. 
The second release is coming soon.
